### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


# missing colon after the 'else'
  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
   
#  function declerartion is dif instead of def
# the if statement is not indented 
# no comma after card1
# the first return statement doesnt specify card1
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  

# variable total is not assigned to anything shoud = 0
# the indentation is all off for this block return statement should start in line with the for statement. and it should all then be indented one tab to the right.
def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
